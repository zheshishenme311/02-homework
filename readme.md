This is my first responsive portfolio, and this is the version 1.0. I am still working on the font size and color, also I need to fix the pic size at the portfolio page later and make them be the same size.The UI looks like disaster now.
I have made three pages: index page, portfolio page and contact page.
Index.html page: this page design for explaining about myself.
portfolio.html page: work with bootstrap and use the card component to layout.
contact.html page: this page use the form component to complete.
All the three page should be able to fit the different size of screen.
